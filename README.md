# What is YAFAM?
**YAFAM** is a Minecraft Mod pack created for a group of friends to play in a modded Minecraft Server Environment.

# Why is the file repo hosted in Github, but not AWS or Curseforge?
This is a backup file repo in event certain file are not retrievable from the server itself. I dont plan to use AWS because it is too unnecessary for author like me.

## Excerpt context from Curseforge
Ever thought of playing Minecraft with just food automation only, or even think of trying to play a chilling Minecraft Experience with farming involved?

With YAFAM, you can! Because this modpack is designed to allow you to do farming, mining and automation without compromise the Minecraft Vanilla experience. YAFAM is curated by 1.17 contents but have the additional automation which gives player the freedom to choose what they want for their Minecraft Experience. As the pack is designed for potato specification computer, there isn't any much heavy modification involved; however it is guaranteed that it will gives out an unique experience as compared to the vanilla experience.

With the mod pack is still a **WORK IN PROGRESS**! We believed that with the feedback from whoever who played, we can make the pack a much optimized minecraft pack.
